		<b><h4>Early Childhood - Middle School</h4></b>
	</div>

		<h5>I came into this world predisposed to adversity at birth. On October 11, 1993, weighing in at 6lbs, 3oz, I graced this good earth 6 weeks premature. Complications were to be inevitable. Throughout most of my early adolescent years, I struggled mightily with speech, sociability and hyperactivity. Though unwilling to be deterred, I sought out practice and repetition as a means to overcome obstacles at an early age.</h5>
		<h5>Fast forward to middle school —> I no longer require a speech therapist, counseling,  nor medication just to get by. During these most formidable years, I took interest in a dizzying array of activities including baseball, basketball, tennis, hockey, golf, track, martial arts, gymnastics, skateboarding, snowboarding, skiing, dirt biking, band, filming, and video editing. Naturally my interests would consolidate eventually, and sometime during the eighth grade I decided that baseball was my destiny</h5>

		<h4>High School</h4>

		<h5>I attended Grand Junction High School from 2008 - 2012. Scholastically, I excelled in science and economics. My freshman year, I was the only freshmen to earn a spot on the varsity baseball roster. I earned all-conference honors all four years, all-state my junior and senior, and all-American my senior year. My plan was to get drafted out of high school, as my brother had done before me. Also, I had zero desire or intention to attend college.</h5>
		<h5>Things took a sharp left toward the end of my senior year while participating in a pre-draft workout in California. During a timed base running exercise, I slid out rounding a bag, injuring my sacroiliac joint in my right hip. My injury rendered me immobile for weeks, unable to attend any future pre-draft workouts, thus damaging any prospects I had for the draft. With little time to spare and a big decision to be made regarding my future, I signed on with Iowa Western CC. on athletic scholarship.</h5>

		<h4>College - Current</h4>
	</div>
	<hr>
	<div class="bio-con" id="bottom">
		<h5>Unlike how most people feel upon their arrival at college, I almost felt defeated. My injury from the previous spring was still lingering, and fall conditioning only caused greater irritation. Half way through the season I was placed on injured reserve. Or in other words, they had me doing nothing. I had time to kill, and an opportunity to explore other endeavors.</h5>
		<h5>I began applying my knowledge and interest in economics toward learning how to trade currencies. From January until June 2013, I spent hours every day in my dorm honing in my abilities as a market speculator. I ran numerous demo accounts simultaneously, each using  a different strategy. By doing this I was efficiently able to pinpoint strengths and weaknesses in each strategy, and apply those observations to an end.</h5>
		<h5>I left college after the spring with no intention to return.</h5>
		<h5>I returned home to live with my parents until i could get on my feet. With my plan now ready to take motion, I took what little I had in my savings and began trading with live money. Slowly but surely, my account grew to a point of sustainability. I moved out of the nest and got my own place.</h5>
		<h5>As time progressed and so did the markets, the work became grueling, regularly working 12 - 14hr days during times of low volatility whereas it’s virtually impossible to make money. It was during this time that I had my first exposure to programming software while learning how to build custom charting indicators and automated trading systems. In addition, I also taught myself basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It wasn't long before I came to the realization that it was time to make a career change.</h5>
		<h5>Using almost all the money I'd made from trading, I hopped ship and moved to Boulder in order to attend the RefactorU Web Development Bootcamp. With memories of a failed college experience still fresh in the back of my mind, returning to the classroom again seemed like hell. But it wasn't, in fact, I enjoyed it immensely. Every day was a new challenge, every week a new technology to be learned. I couldn't get enough of it, unlike the monotony of traditional education.</h5>
		<h5>Fast forward to now, and I'm currently living the dream as a web developer in downtown Denver. Since March of 2016, Iv'e been working for a company called IT5280, as well as doing contract and charity work on the side. As of right now, I AM ACTIVELY SEEKING NEW OPPORTUNITIES in the field of web development that will be more challenging and demanding than my current job.</h5>
